# MacroMinder
# Update for 8/30/2024

## Project Overview
MacroMinder - A Web App to track your macros and habits through the week!

#### User Features

Users have full CRUD functionality for Habits, being able to view a list of their daily habits while being able to edit and delete them as they wish.\
Users can also input Macro Data, and are limited to one input per day, however any subsequent inputs will edit the submission for that day to reflect the new input.\
Macro/habit data is reflected in the Plotly line graphs and charts. \
Users also have access to a list of the current signed-up lifecoaches, where they can choose a lifecoach to 'pair to'.

#### Lifecoach Features

Lifecoaches have access to any paired Users dashboard, allowing them to add macro and habits for them.\
Lifecoaches can be paired to many users, but users can only have one lifecoach.

Please note that some of these may not be required, but when troubleshooting we found that after running these, the actual server decided to open.
